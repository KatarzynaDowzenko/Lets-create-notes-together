## Let's create notes together

### Description

This is a web-based application designed to connect people into groups that can create boards with different kinds of notes, with a calendar and with chat.

You log in to the application with a Google or Microsoft account. Using their integration, you can add events to your calendar.
On the board you can add notes, cards, check lists and day planners.
You can mark each form of note as to whether it is a priority, mark the people involved and the expiration date of the note.
